Large-scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have shown impressive performance across general computer vision tasks. Trained on massive amounts of natural images, these models generate robust and generalisable representations. However, their effectiveness in specialised domains, such as geosciences, remote sensing, and medical imaging, is still limited.
</p>

This project investigates the representation robustness of large-scale VFMs to the increasing distribution discrepancies from natural images. Explore metrics, methods, and computationally efficient strategies to adapt or enhance the pre-training of  VFMs in this challenge scenario.

The research now is transition from the investigation of large-scale VFM feature spaces to the exploration of new approaches for the adaptation of VFMs. 

While large-scale models dominate the current landscape in computer science, there is a rich and often overlooked frontier beyond that place. Where domains intersect and geoscientists, medical researchers, and remote sensing experts actually share similar challenges and opportunities. This project aims to contribute toward bridging that gap, by exploring how vision foundation models can be adapted to specialised domains where data is limited, expert knowledge is essential, and the potential for real-world impact is significant.
